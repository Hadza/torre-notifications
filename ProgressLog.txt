Progress Log

January 26

10:52am - 2:05pm -> Explored Torre's current features, jobs/gigs, search criteria, genome and signals.
3:00pm - 5:22pm -> Started brainstorming ideas based on the current features, accessible data and time limit.
                   Two ideas came out of brainstorming, one for a coding challenge platform integration linked by username
                   but I couldn't find a coding challenge platform with a public API.
                   The second and chosen idea was a job notification feature for desktop and mobile.
5:30pm - 7:34pm -> Analyzed the problem and data model to get around the technology stack.
                   Decided on VueJS and Vuetify on the front-end and Firebase on the back-end.
                   VueJS will serve great for fast development and I'll be using Firebase Cloud Functions to run a
                   Pub/Sub that will check registered user new opportunities and send them through notifications using
                   Firebase Cloud Messaging while also storing the data on Firestore to avoid sending already sent
                   notifications.
                   The notification criteria will be limited to "best for" and "dream job" as per the time limit.
8:00pm - 9:00pm -> Created and made the initial configuration of the VueJS project, GitHub repository, Firebase project
10:28pm - 11:00pm -> Connected VueJS project with Firebase, initialized both Firestore and Messaging. Commited changes to GitHub
